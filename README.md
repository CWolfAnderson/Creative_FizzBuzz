### code-task

IMHO there are three things that make a good developer (read as problem solver). I am really assessing your 'well roundedness' as a technical builder and personal collaborator. When everything is on the table, we are all equal, and I will learn as much as you do, as long as you take your task seriously.

1. Abstract thinking & problem solving
2. Creativity  
3. Practical Application
4. Communication

That said, the sections below to this task will, likely, show me more than you think. Please have fun, and approach them as you would something that you were doing for yourself, I am sure that you could easily use this task to really impress someone beside myself (especially if the last section is on point).

#### FizzBuzz
I am a big proponent of this one, for abstraction, we all know what to do but there are many routes to take to the end result.  

_note: as you may know, solutions abound on the internet for this question. I don't consider myself ignorant or naive, so please don't think that I am, try and craft a solution that is your own_

#### Creativity
As a front end dev, you are always the last line of creativity in the UI/UX design of the digital deliverable. Under the heading of creativity, I would like to see what you come up with as a method of output to the above solution (the FizzBuzz). In other words, using the console to log your output may not be enough. Show me what you want to when it comes to your FE skills.

#### Practical Application
I am only a fan of a library when it is necessary to move quickly or if there is legacy code, and since you will be 'from scratch' on this this task, I don't want to see how well you can use jQuery, or anything like that. So, explicitly, ONLY plan ole 'vanilla' JavaScript CSS HTML and only what will be readily interpreted by the current Chrome Canary build.

#### Communication
I believe that a good communicator is someone who can help me see a thing through their eyes, as such, I would like you to 'show your work' in this way. Help me understand the route you took to get to your ultimate solution, start to finish.


Please, pull down this repo and treat that as your project folder, and make a branch that will contain your own code, don't use master. (branch naming should read as first initial underscore last name, so my branch would be called `d_johnson`)
